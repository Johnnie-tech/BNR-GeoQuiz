# BNR-GeoQuiz
Project #1 from big nerd ranch android programming book.

App has an array of trivia questions.
Answering true or false will show a toast verifing that the correct answer has been picked.

Todo:

Challenge: Add a Listener to the TextView
Your Next button is nice, but you could also make it so that a user could press the TextView itself to see
the next question.
Hint: You can use the View.OnClickListener listener for the TextView that you have used with the
Button s, because TextView also inherits from View .

Challenge: From Button to ImageButton
Perhaps the user interface would look even better if the next and previous buttons showed only icons
